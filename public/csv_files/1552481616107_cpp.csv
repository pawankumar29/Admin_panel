"For sharable resources, mutual exclusion :",,is required,is not required,Depends on Scheduling,Depends on CPU,B
What is a long-term scheduler ?,,It selects which process has to be brought into the ready queue,It selects which process has to be executed next and allocates CPU,It selects which process to remove from memory by swapping,None of these,A
Scheduling is done so as to :,,increase the turnaround time,decrease the turnaround time,keep the turnaround time same,there is no relation between scheduling and turnaround time,B
In a multi-programming environment :,,the processor executes more than one process at a time,the programs are developed by more than one person,more than one process resides in the memory,a single user can execute many programs at the same time,C
